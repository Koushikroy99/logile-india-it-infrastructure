## üè¢ Floor-wise Department Mapping

| Floor          | Departments                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ground Floor   | Reception Staff and Security Guard Office    |
| 1st Floor      | Desktop Support, Quality Assurance, HR       |
| 2nd Floor      | IT Department + Core Servers                 |
| 3rd Floor      | Managing Director's Chamber, Accounts Office |
| Special Area   | Sensitive Server Room (Restricted Access)    |

## üõ† Design Highlights

- **Three-Layer Architecture** (Access Layer, Distribution Layer, Core Layer)
- **VLAN Segmentation** by Department
- **Dual ISP Internet Connectivity** (Primary + Backup)
- **Firewall Protection** using Cisco ASA
- **Separate VLANs for CCTV Surveillance and IoT Devices**
- **Monitoring Server** for proactive device health checks
- **Wi-Fi Network** for staff and visitors
- **Secure Server Room** with restricted physical and network access

---

## üß† Why the Design Was Made This Way (Experience-Based Insights)

- **Layered Design:** Makes the network scalable and easier to manage.
- **VLANs:** Secure each department‚Äôs traffic and minimize risks.
- **Firewall:** Protects internal assets from external threats.
- **Redundancy (Dual ISP):** Ensures maximum internet uptime.
- **Separate CCTV Network:** Isolates security devices from main business traffic.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Detect network issues early to prevent downtime.
- **Server Room Security:** Physical and network-level protection for sensitive data.
